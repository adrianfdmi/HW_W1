# Homework_W1
This readme doc is to mark the logic and steps for the Assigment of Week 1
1. I started with opening the HTML and the CSS side by side to understand the logic and the structure
2. I checked on the integrity of the links. Everything seemed ok in terms of the images URLs
3. I started to mark with comments the to dos for the HTML and the CSS (I realized I do not know if there are anyway to put comments on the CSS, but since I'm on a plane with no internet connectiviy, will have to check later)
4. I need to copen a repo on GitHub. I have already created the files on my computer
5. I changed the title, to make it more descriptive
6. Added id="search-engine-optimization" on 38
7. 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif
8. Added alt definitions on all images and icons except for the background one
